Hello Professor Nugyen, 

  I have attached all of the files related to the final project in this repository, including my reflection. 
  
  The presentation files were pretty big so I have included the public link to them in the document labeled Final Presentation Links as well as below.

  Also for your convenience I have included the public links to the other documents incase you would prefer to not download the files to view them. The documents as well as my course reflection are below.
